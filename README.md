# go-aws
Go package for Amazon AWS API

Go package to manage AWS API connection

- Very early stage
- V4 signature for GET (rest of methods won't work until further modification)
- EC2 package started (DescribeRegions working)

Planned 

- Focus on IAM methods
- Finish aws.go to manage all kind of methods


Suggestions and corrections are welcome, since I'm using this development to learn Go.
